## dotsecenv vs SOPS

[SOPS](https://getsops.io/) (Secrets OPerationS) is Mozilla's tool for encrypting configuration files.

### What SOPS Does Well

SOPS is an excellent, battle-tested tool for production secrets:

- **In-place encryption** of YAML, JSON, ENV, and INI files
- **Multiple backends**: GPG, AWS KMS, GCP KMS, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault
- **Partial encryption**: Encrypt only values, leaving keys readable
- **Editor integration**: Decrypt, edit, re-encrypt seamlessly

### Key Differences

| Aspect | dotsecenv | SOPS |
|--------|-----------|------|
| **Primary use case** | Developer workflow | Production config |
| **File format** | Dedicated vault (JSONL) | Existing configs (YAML/JSON) |
| **Identity management** | First-class (share/revoke) | None (manage keys yourself) |
| **Shell integration** | Built-in `.secenv` plugins | None (use with direnv) |
| **Audit trail** | Append-only history | Git history |
| **Cloud KMS** | No | Yes (AWS, GCP, Azure) |

### When to Choose

**Choose dotsecenv if:**

- You want integrated shell plugins for auto-loading
- You need explicit share/revoke commands for team management
- You prefer GPG-only with no cloud dependencies
- Developer workflow is your primary use case

**Choose SOPS if:**

- You use cloud KMS (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- You want to encrypt existing config files in-place
- You need HashiCorp Vault integration
- Production secrets management is the priority

<Aside type="note">
SOPS can use GPG for multi-recipient encryption, but you manage the key list manually in `.sops.yaml`. dotsecenv provides explicit `share` and `revoke` commands.

## dotsecenv vs direnv

[direnv](https://direnv.net/) is an environment switcher for shells—it loads and unloads environment variables as you change directories.

### Similarities

Both tools:

- Integrate with bash, zsh, and fish
- Load environment variables on directory change
- Have trust/allow mechanisms for security

### Key Differences

| Aspect | dotsecenv | direnv |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Configuration** | Key-value `.secenv` files | Shell script `.envrc` files |
| **Encryption** | Yes (GPG) | None |
| **Execution** | Loads values only | Runs arbitrary shell commands |
| **Security model** | Trust + encryption | Trust only |

### Using Together

direnv and dotsecenv complement each other:

```bash
# .envrc (direnv) - Non-sensitive setup
export PATH="$PWD/bin:$PATH"
layout python
eval "$(dotsecenv completion bash)"

# .secenv (dotsecenv) - Encrypted secrets
DATABASE_PASSWORD={dotsecenv}
API_KEY={dotsecenv}
```

**Choose direnv for:** PATH manipulation, language version switching, project-specific shell setup

**Choose dotsecenv for:** Encrypted secrets that should never appear in plaintext files

## dotsecenv vs HashiCorp Vault

[HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) is an enterprise secrets management platform with extensive features.

### What Vault Does Well

Vault is the industry standard for production secrets:

- **Dynamic secrets**: Generate database credentials on-demand
- **Secret rotation**: Automatic credential rotation
- **PKI**: Certificate authority for TLS
- **Transit encryption**: Encrypt data without storing it
- **Access policies**: Fine-grained RBAC
- **Audit logging**: Comprehensive activity tracking

### Key Differences

| Aspect | dotsecenv | HashiCorp Vault |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Architecture** | File-based, no server | Client-server |
| **Deployment** | None required | Server infrastructure |
| **Dynamic secrets** | No | Yes |
| **Secret rotation** | Manual | Automatic |
| **Complexity** | Low | High |
| **Cost** | Free | Free (OSS) / Enterprise |

### When to Choose

**Choose dotsecenv if:**

- You want simple, file-based secrets without infrastructure
- Your team is small to medium size
- You prefer git-based workflows
- Developer workflow is the focus

**Choose Vault if:**

- You need dynamic secrets (rotating DB passwords)
- You require enterprise features (namespaces, HSM, replication)
- You have a dedicated platform team
- Production-scale secrets management is required

<Aside type="note">
Vault can be overkill for developer workflows. Many teams use dotsecenv for development and Vault for production.
