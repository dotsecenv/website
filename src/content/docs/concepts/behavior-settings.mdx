## Overview

dotsecenv provides granular behavior settings that control how the tool handles various edge cases and error conditions. These settings replace the previous all-or-nothing `strict: true` flag with fine-grained controls.

<Aside type="caution" title="Deprecation Notice">
  The `strict: true` configuration option is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Please migrate to the granular behavior settings described below.
</Aside>

## Configuration

Behavior settings are configured in your `~/.config/dotsecenv/config.yaml` file under the `behavior` section:

```yaml
behavior:
  require_explicit_vault_upgrade: false
  fail_on_integrity_error: false
  require_config_vaults: false
```

## Available Settings

### `require_explicit_vault_upgrade`

Controls whether vault format upgrades happen automatically or require explicit user action.

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `false` (default) | Vaults are automatically upgraded to the latest format with a notice |
| `true` | Warns about outdated format but doesn't modify; requires `dotsecenv vault upgrade` |

**Use case:** Set to `true` in shared environments where you want to coordinate vault upgrades across team members.

```yaml
behavior:
  require_explicit_vault_upgrade: true
```

When enabled, you'll see:
```
dotsecenv: warning: vault "/path/to/vault" uses format v1, upgrade to v2 recommended
dotsecenv: run 'dotsecenv vault upgrade' to upgrade the vault format
```

### `fail_on_integrity_error`

Controls how dotsecenv handles configuration and vault file errors during operations.

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `false` (default) | Warns about errors and continues with healthy files |
| `true` | Fails the operation if any config or vault has errors |

**Use case:** Set to `true` in CI/CD pipelines where you want strict validation.

```yaml
behavior:
  fail_on_integrity_error: true
```

### `require_config_vaults`

Controls whether CLI `-v` flags can override vaults specified in the configuration file.

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `false` (default) | CLI `-v` flags can specify different vaults than config |
| `true` | CLI `-v` flags are ignored; only config vaults are used |

**Use case:** Set to `true` to prevent accidental use of wrong vaults in production.

```yaml
behavior:
  require_config_vaults: true
```

## Simplified Behaviors

Several behaviors that were previously controlled by `strict: true` now have sensible defaults that cannot be changed:

| Behavior | Default | Rationale |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Flag conflicts (`--last -v`) | Always error | Conflicting flags should fail early |
| Secret fallback | Always allowed with warning | Supports multi-user private values |
| Identity already exists | Always warn + skip | Fingerprints are unique |
| Identity auto-add | Always warn + auto-add | Convenient default |
| Revoke unknown identity | Always warn + proceed | Revoke should complete |
| Decrypt errors | Always warn + try others | Best-effort recovery |

### Secret Fallback Behavior

When a user requests a secret but cannot access the latest value (e.g., their access was revoked), dotsecenv will:

1. Attempt to decrypt older values that the user can still access
2. Print a warning: `warning: returning older value for 'SECRET_NAME' (access to latest value is revoked)`
3. Return the most recent accessible value

This allows multi-user scenarios where each user maintains their own private values.

## GPG Program Configuration

The GPG program path is now configured explicitly:

```yaml
gpg:
  program: PATH           # Infer from system PATH (recommended)
  # OR
  program: /usr/bin/gpg   # Absolute path to specific binary
```

<Aside type="note">
  An empty or missing `gpg.program` value will cause an error. You must explicitly set it to `PATH` or provide an absolute path.
</Aside>

## Migration from `strict: true`

If you currently use `strict: true`, here's how to migrate:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Before">
```yaml
# Old configuration
strict: true
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="After">
```yaml
# New configuration - choose which behaviors you need
behavior:
  require_explicit_vault_upgrade: true
  fail_on_integrity_error: true
  require_config_vaults: true

gpg:
  program: /usr/bin/gpg  # Or PATH
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `strict: true` shorthand still works during the deprecation period and is equivalent to setting all three behavior flags to `true`.

### Hybrid Configuration

You can use `strict: true` with individual overrides:

```yaml
strict: true
behavior:
  require_explicit_vault_upgrade: false  # Override: allow auto-upgrades
```

## Example Configurations

### Development Environment

```yaml
approved_algorithms:
  - algo: RSA
    min_bits: 2048
vault:
  - ~/.local/share/dotsecenv/vault
gpg:
  program: PATH
# behavior section omitted - all defaults (permissive)
```

### Production / CI Environment

```yaml
approved_algorithms:
  - algo: ECC
    curves: [P-384, P-521]
    min_bits: 384
vault:
  - /secure/path/to/vault
behavior:
  fail_on_integrity_error: true
  require_config_vaults: true
gpg:
  program: /usr/bin/gpg
```

### Shared Team Environment

```yaml
approved_algorithms:
  - algo: RSA
    min_bits: 4096
vault:
  - ~/projects/myapp/.dotsecenv/vault
behavior:
  require_explicit_vault_upgrade: true  # Coordinate upgrades
gpg:
  program: PATH
```
